One thing [people](https://feedback.unity3d.com/suggestions/editor-camera-fov-adjustable) [repeatedly say](https://feedback.unity3d.com/suggestions/scene-view-camera-field-of-view-adjustment) is missing in Unity Editor's Scene View is that there is no way to control the Field of View (FoV).
With this extension, you will now be able to do this using the Unity Editor's private API.


## How to use

- Import [this .unitypackage](https://github.com/t-mat/UnitySceneViewFovControl/releases/download/0.1.11/SceneViewFovControl.unitypackage) to your Unity project.
    - Import from the file by selecting "Assets > Import Package > Custom Package."
- You will be able to do the following in Scene View after importing.

|Keyboard/Mouse					|Effect							|Note			|
|--------------------				|-------------------------				|----			|
|`FoV` button in the toolbar of Scene View	|Toggle FoV mode (auto / manual)			|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + Wheel				|Changes FoV						|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Wheel			|Changes FoV (high speed)				|Unavailable on Mac	|
|Ctrl + Alt + O					|Increases FoV (wide angle)				|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + P					|Reduces FoV (narrow angle/telescopic)			|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + Shift + O				|Increases FoV (high speed, wide angle)			|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + Shift + P				|Reduces FoV (high speed, narrow angle/telescopic)	|			|

You can also right click the `FoV` button to use the following functionalities

|Menu name					|Effect						|Note							|
|--------------------				|-------------------------			|----							|
|FoV : Auto (Default behaviour)			|Set FoV mode to "Auto"				|"Auto" means Unity Editor's normal behaviour		|
|FoV : Manual					|Set FoV mode to "Manual"			|							|
|Reset Follower Camera				|Reset Follower Camera				|							|
|Follower Camera submenu			|You can select a camera which follows SceneView|If there're multiple Scene/GameView, you can set them independently	|


## Changing and Saving Settings

Select "Edit" > "Scene View FoV Settings" in the Unity Editor menu to open the settings window.
